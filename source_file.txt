A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed
Which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed she will undress
And then she's boxing clever

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

Day's dawning, skins crawling
Pure morning

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed
Which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

Day's dawning, skins crawling 
Pure morning 

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed she will undress
And then she's boxing clever

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather


Don't you wish you'd never met her ?
Lay him down, lie on
Lay him... down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground,
I'll be watching, when he's around.
Now your lover went and put me in the ground,
I'll be watching...

Lay him down, lie on
Lay him... down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground,
I'll be watching, when he's around.
Now your lover went and put me in the ground,
I'll be watching...when he's around

When you cum you never make a single sound,
I'll be watching, when he's around,
When he's around, when he's around,
He's around.

Don't you wish you'd never met her 

Lay him down, lie on
Lay him... down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground,
I'll be watching, when he's around.
Now your lover went and put me in the ground,
I'll be watching...when he's around

When you cum you never make a single sound,
I'll be watching, when he's around,
When he's around, when he's around,
He's around.

Don't you wish you'd never met her ?

If it's a bad day, you try to suffocate.
Another memory... scarred.
If it's a bad case, then you accelerate,
you're in the getaway... car.

If it's a bad case, you're on the rampage.
Another memory... scarred.
You're at the wrong place, you're on the back page,
you're in the getaway... car.

It's your age, It's my rage.

You're too complicated, we should separate it.
You're just confiscating, you're exasperating.
This degeneration, mental masturbation.
Think I'll leave it all behind, save this bleeding heart of mine.

Time to pass you to the test. Hanging on my lover's breath.
Always coming second best. Pictures of my lover's chest.
Get through this night, there are no second chances.
This time I might.
To ask the sea for answers.
Always falling to the floor, softer than it was before.
Dog boy - media whore, it's who the hell you take me for.

Give up this fight, there are no second chances.
This time I might.
To ask the sea for answers.
These bonds are shackle free, wrapped in lust and lunacy.
Tiny touch of jealousy, these bonds are shackle free.

Get through this night, there are no second chances.
This time I might.
To ask the sea for answers.

Get through this, there are no second chances.
This time. To ask the sea for answers.

Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
Over-saturation curls the skin and tans the hide

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You've never seen the lonely me at all

I
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I
Fall
Without you, I'm Nothing
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Without you, I'm nothing at all
Any means in your horizon
Heaven in a tourniquet
The after life to keep your eyes on
bitter pill you take you take today
With expert levitation forward,
polished to the nth degree,
it takes it's smile from every children,
you take the beating.

Any means in your horizon
Every mink walks two by two,
we gamble to be born again
You know I never wanted to
With expert levitation forward,
polished to the nth degree,
it takes it's smile from every children,
you take the beating.

The light divining,

It takes the pain away
that could not make you stay
it's way to broke to fix
no glue, no bag of tricks

Your smile would make me sneeze
when we were Siamese
Amazing grace in here
I'd pay to have you near.

Lay me down, the lie will unfurl
lay me down to crawl.

Don't go and lose your face
at some stranger's place
and don't forget to breathe
and pay before you leave


Stuck between the do or die, I feel emaciated.
Hard to breathe I try and try, I'll get asphyxiated.
Swinging from the tallest height, with nothing left to hold on to.

Every sky is blue, but not for me and you.

Come home, come home, come home, come home.

Glass and petrol vodka gin, it feels like breathing methane.
Throw yourself from skin to skin, and still it doesn't dull the pain.
Vanish like a lipstick trace, it always blows me away.

Every cloud is grey, with dreams of yesterday.

Always goes against the grain, and I can try and deny it
Give a monkey half a brain, and still he's bound to fry it.
Now the happening scene is dead, I used to want to be there too.

Every sky is blue, but not for me and you.

Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up, our passion's spent
My heart's a tart, your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is bent
Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed
'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Sucker love, a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse
In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
'Cause there's nothing else to do

Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heaven's sake
There's never been so much at stake
I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late
'Cause there's nothing else to do

Like the naked leads the blind
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
Sucker love I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind
All alone in space and time
There's nothing here but what here's mine
Something borrowed, something blue
